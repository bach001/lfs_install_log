# by using strace to trace the firefox, it shows that firefox hangs on a connect call(why?)

# but the dns nameserver is very slow to respond

# edit resolv.conf using another ip 

# but resolv.conf gets updated by dhcpcd periodically

# disabling update using --nohook -reslov.conf,-hostname

The default for dhcpcd is to set the hostname and mtu. 
It also overwrites /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/ntp.conf. 
These modifications to system files are done by hooks which are stored 
in /usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks. Setup dhcpcd by removing or adding hooks 
from/to that directory. The execution of hooks can be disabled by using 
the --nohook (-C) command line option or by the nohook option in the /etc/dhcpcd.conf file.
