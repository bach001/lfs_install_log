# Chrome's support from hardware acceleration

Xorg only. Wayland is not supported. XWayland exhibits choppiness FS#67035.

## this means xwayland is supported, but with issues.


# read this page and follow the guide

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chromium#Hardware_video_acceleration

especially this section: Hardware video acceleration

Note:

There is no official support from Chromium or Arch Linux for this feature [4]. 
However, chromium from official repositories is compiled with VA-API support and you 
may ask for help in the dedicated forum thread.

VA-API does not work with the chromium package when using the native Wayland backend, 
but it does work in chromium-wayland-vaapiAUR.


To enable VA-API support in Chromium:

Install the correct VA-API driver for your video card and verify VA-API has been enabled 
and working correctly, see Hardware video acceleration. For proprietary NVIDIA support, 
installing libva-vdpau-driver-chromiumAUR or libva-vdpau-driver-vp9-git AUR is required.

## this one is done


Set the option --enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder. This is enough when using ANGLE GL 
renderer and libva-intel-driver.

## this one is done


When using ANGLE, Chromium forces the older i965 driver and fails when intel-media-driver 
is used. As a workaround, configure VA-API manually. See [5] for details.

## this one is done


To use the system GL renderer on Xorg, use either --use-gl=egl or --use-gl=desktop. 
On XWayland, use the --use-gl=egl flag (Currently exhibits choppiness FS#67035 on some systems).

## this one is done  XWayland --use-gl=egl


If VA-API still does not work, try the --disable-features=UseChromeOSDirectVideoDecoder flag [6]

## this one is done


However, hardware acceleration is still not working.


## Fix: Pass --ignore-gpu-blocklist makes it work.

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/gpu/vaapi.md#vaapi-on-linux

To run Chromium using VaAPI three arguments are necessary:

--enable-features=VaapiVideoDecoder
--ignore-gpu-blocklist
--use-gl=desktop or --use-gl=egl


# Caveat: some codecs might not supported by gpu driver, especially for a relatively old chip.
