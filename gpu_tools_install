## Procps vs Procps-ng

from https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-April/022845.html

The procps project didn't had any new release for a while and the
current package use a dozen of patches to fix miscellenaous things.
I'm thinking about switching to procps-ng[1]. Procps-ng is a fork of
procps by Debian, Fedora and openSUSE.  Gentoo is also using procps-ng
(although, like Debian, the package is still named procps).

Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_nvidia.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Actually, other manufacturers have started releasing VDPAU-compatible drivers 
(but of course you still need one). The generic libvdpau is only a wrapper around 
your driver's implementation. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU – fkraiem  Mar 9, 2014 at 21:08 

It's not answering your original question, but I'm guessing that because you're trying 
to use a VDPAU driver with a VA-API backend, you may find this useful (particularly 
the section about MPlayer). 

libvdpau is also **hardcoded** to load the NVidia driver according to this link. – mjturner Jul 21, 2015 at 15:29
