# Procps vs Procps-ng

The procps project didn't had any new release for a while and the
current package use a dozen of patches to fix miscellenaous things.
I'm thinking about switching to procps-ng[1]. Procps-ng is a fork of
procps by Debian, Fedora and openSUSE.  Gentoo is also using procps-ng
(although, like Debian, the package is still named procps).
