## Procps vs Procps-ng

from https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2012-April/022845.html

The procps project didn't had any new release for a while and the
current package use a dozen of patches to fix miscellenaous things.
I'm thinking about switching to procps-ng[1]. Procps-ng is a fork of
procps by Debian, Fedora and openSUSE.  Gentoo is also using procps-ng
(although, like Debian, the package is still named procps).

The libvdpau package contains a library which implements the VDPAU library.

VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source library (libvdpau) and API originally designed by Nvidia for its GeForce 8 series and later GPU hardware targeted at the X Window System. This VDPAU API allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.

Currently, the portions capable of being offloaded by VDPAU onto the GPU are motion compensation (mo comp), inverse discrete cosine transform (iDCT), VLD (variable-length decoding) and deblocking for MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1, WMV3/WMV9 encoded videos. Which specific codecs of these that can be offloaded to the GPU depends on the version of the GPU hardware; specifically, to also decode MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), Xvid/OpenDivX (DivX 4), and DivX 5 formats, a GeForce 200M (2xxM) Series (the eleventh generation of Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units) or newer GPU hardware is required.

Actually, other manufacturers have started releasing VDPAU-compatible drivers 
(but of course you still need one). The generic libvdpau is only a wrapper around 
your driver's implementation. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU – fkraiem  Mar 9, 2014 at 21:08 

It's not answering your original question, but I'm guessing that because you're trying 
to use a VDPAU driver with a VA-API backend, you may find this useful (particularly 
the section about MPlayer). 

libvdpau is also **hardcoded** to load the NVidia driver according to this link. – mjturner Jul 21, 2015 at 15:29
