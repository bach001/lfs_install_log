#1 first of all, updated mesa https://archive.mesa3d.org//mesa-22.2.2.tar.xz

#2 it looks for i915 but Mesa-22.2.2 installation has no i965_dri.so

I had the same problem and the same references to Iris.


I solved the porblem by adding in: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf: 

Code:

Section "Device"
        Identifier "Intel Graphics"
        Driver "intel"
        Option "AccelMethod" "sna"
        Option "DRI" "iris"
EndSection

#4 name confusion clarification

=================================================================================================================

The kernel DRM module for Intel GPU hardware is called i915, mainly for historical reasons. 
Although it's called like that, it handles the entire of range of Intel GPUs (well, most of it).

The userspace side is divided into i915, i965 and i915g -- the two classic mesa drivers and the gallium driver.

========================================================================================

For example, the Mesa project has separate DRI drivers i915_dri.so and i965_dri.so 
(as well as crocus_dri and iris_dri) for different generations of Intel GPUs â€“ 
all four of those expect to talk to i915.ko on the kernel side.

Same goes for VA-API; the i965_drv_video.so VA-API driver is the correct one for 
most older Intel GPUs, while iHD_drv_video.so is for Skylake and later, 
but all of them would still use the i915.ko kernel driver.

========================================================================================

in a nutshell 

i915 is kernel driver, userspace side has i915_dri.so i965_dri.so crocus_dri iris_dri etc
i965_drv_video is for VA-API that is to say hardware acceleration


#5 Xorg.1.log shows that it finally works
