VLC 3.0.x hardware acceleration is broken

https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/multimedia/vlc.html

--disable-libva: This switch is required to disable video acceleration in VLC 
since it is incompatible with ffmpeg-5, and upstream has no plans to port it due to complexity.



[VLC3] Support FFmpeg 5.0 (except for VAAPI)
