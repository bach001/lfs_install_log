# run from console error: Could not get primary session for user no data available

  googling online but to no avail, Just dive into the source code, 
  
  it shows that sway will try to find a XDG_SESSION_ID env
  
  variable to find the user session info but get no result. 
  
  The analysis is that there's somethingwrong with elogind; 
  
  Shadow package needs to be reinstalled after installing after installing Linux PAM package and
  
  be properyly configured.
  

Error fix: reinstalling shadow package resulting in `su -` failure.

  reboot with a bootable image, mount the file system, install and configure in chroot env.
  
  
# Bonus: eloginctl can be used to suspend the system.

# Properly configured elogind will manage usering login session correctly, and XDG* variables

  all get automatically set
