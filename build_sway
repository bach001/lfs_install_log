#1 After installation but it won't work complaining that 

   it could not find a primary session
   
   An apparent clue might be that loginctl command shows no sessions.
   
   

#2 Dive into the source code 

   Conclusion is that sway needs XDG_SESSION_ID to be set properly, in other words, 
   After logging in from console, elogind is responsible for managing user session, 
   Including setting XDG* environment variables.
   
   
#3 The issue comes from forgetting reinstalling Shadow-4.12.2 package after elogind-246.10 install 
   with Linux-PAM-1.5.2 support.
   
   This is mentioned in the instruction of Linux-PAM-1.5.2:
     **You should now reinstall the Shadow-4.12.2 package**
     
     
#4 After reinstall, configuring commands requires root privilege won't work
   Changing to chroot environment to do configuration.
   
   
   
#5 Now, loginctl is happy and sway works.
